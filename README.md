##  Project Highlights

- SQL used to extract key operational insights such as admission rates, peak visit hours, and department-level performance.
- Power BI used to create an interactive dashboard with slicers for hospital location, department, and outcome.
- Custom visuals and KPIs offer stakeholders a clear picture of where to allocate staff and medical equipment.

##  Real-World Scenario

###  Problem
Hospitals struggle with patient overcrowding, especially in Emergency and Surgical units. There’s a need for better data visibility into:
- Department pressure points
- Equipment utilization
- Trends that affect operational planning

###  Outcome
This dashboard helps stakeholders:
- Identify departments with the longest wait times
- Track peak periods and adjust staffing levels
- Visualize how resources like MRI and ventilators are used
- Support better decisions for improving patient throughput

##  Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** – for SQL querying and trend discovery
- **Power BI** – for visualizing insights and interactivity
- **Excel/CSV** – for dataset preparation
